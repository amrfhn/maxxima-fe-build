Multi-Page Site Webpack Stater
A Webpack multi-page site starter project with Twig Templating, Babel, SCSS, SVG spritemap and much more. I hope this template helps you out in building multipage static websites to be integrated with CMSs. I often use this for building the frontend of Umbraco websites.

##File Structure Under the src folder you will find the following

/js - for all your JS
/scss - for all your SCSS, comes with a basic postcss.config.js
/assets/icons - SVGs go here, it will be compiled into a spritemap under /dist/icons/icons.svg
/mocks - for all your JSON mock data
/templates - for all your templates
*.twig - all the twig files under the root of the project will be treated as a page
